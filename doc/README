TODO: Do this f* manual in SGML!!

To install, read the README.1ST file...

DONT'FORGET TO COPY THE DATAFILES in a place where the software can find them!
THIS MEANS, PUT THE *.dat IN THE SAME DIR AS THE BINARY, 
AND EXECUTE IT FROM THE DIR WHERE IT IS, BECAUSE IT WILL
SEARCH IN ./ FIRST (THIS WILL BE FIXED (SOON?)...)

Some Keys (just play with the keyboard...):
Arrow keys move trought menus, ENTER/y -> OK, ESC/q -> cancel
In the fret view: J,U,K,I,arrow keys change tonic & [scale/chord]
                  Y/H/PGUP/PGDWN change instrument
                  Q=quit
		  S=save diagram to text file
		  etc... :^P
